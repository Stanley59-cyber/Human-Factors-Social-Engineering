# Human-Factors-Social-Engineering
Cyber Kill Chain analysis of Twilio phishing incident  [MSC Assignment]
**Type:** Academic Research Assignment (MSc Cybersecurity and Human Factors Bournemouth University)  
**Author:** Stanley Obiekwe

## Objective
This project analyses the Twilio social engineering breach using the Lockheed Martin **Cyber Kill Chain** framework to understand how attackers exploited human behaviour and to recommend practical resilience strategies.

## Key Focus Areas
- Applied the Cyber Kill Chain to map each phase of the attack and reconnaissance through impact.  
- Examined phishing and impersonation tactics used to deceive employees.  
- Analysed psychological and emotional manipulation techniques in successful campaigns.  
- Evaluated impact on customers, trust, and organisational reputation.  
- Proposed mitigations: targeted awareness training, MFA, and improved SOC monitoring.

## Tools & Frameworks
- **Frameworks:** Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK (for mapping adversary behaviours)  
- **Research Methods:** Open-source intelligence review, academic literature, incident reports  
- **Focus:** Human factors, phishing awareness, and Social Engineering detection strategies

## Findings & Outcome
The analysis shows that technical controls alone are not sufficient — social engineering can bypass even advanced defences by exploiting trust and urgency. The Twilio case reinforced the need for human-focused security measures, continuous awareness training, and improved detection of social attack patterns in SOC workflows.

## How this connects to SOC work
This project informs my practical SOC investigations by improving my ability to:
- Recognise social-engineering indicators as part of incident triage.  
- Use contextual intelligence (OSINT) to enrich phishing investigations.  
- Make recommendations that blend technical and human mitigations.
